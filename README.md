- AI/ML & LLMs: because we're basically living in sci-fi.
- Python & Automation: when things just need to work.
- Engineering: the fun of making real things.
- Gaming: PC Master Race, obviously.
- Balance: A little bit of everything... with style.


```bash
$ git commit -m "Code is life. Gaming is passion. Engineering is logic."
